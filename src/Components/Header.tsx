    My name is Sara, and Iâ€™m an aspiring developer with a 
    background in UI/UX design and IT. I specialize in front-end 
    development using TypeScript and React, but I aim to become 
    a full-stack developer eventually. I thoroughly enjoy learning 
    and self-improvement, and I'm eager to continue exploring ways 
    to write cleaner and more efficient code. Feel free to view my 
    work and learn more about me below.
