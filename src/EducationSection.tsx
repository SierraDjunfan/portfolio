    I initially became interested in programming when I needed better and more customised solutions to my own productivity workflows.
    I began tutoring under Ryan Hayward, a professional, Brisbane-based, full-stack developer/consultant with many years experience. 
    Once I had developed a basic understanding, I continued learning in the form of online courses, collaboration, and, most importantly, developing personal projects.
    I do not have a formal university degree related to development but I am confident that I have the learning skills and the motivation to pick up any new required technologies.
    Below, I have listed a selection of courses which I have completed or books I have read that have continued to educate me over time.

                        <p>I used to live by the words "Good code is less code." This book made me realise that good code is actually code which can be interpreted, expanded and reused easily by both the original programmer and any new collaborators even at the expense of potentially more characters.</p>

                        <p>Although this is an older book, the core concepts really helped me to make decisions about when to put in extra time up front in order to save time later.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Level Up Your Code with Game Programming Patterns - Wilmer Lin 2021</h2>
                        <p>This book was a great resource for understanding the philosophy behind choosing time-tested design patterns to create code expandability and avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>

                    <li>

                        <p>Although the book is centered around game design, I was able to develop knowledge of universally useful design patterns such as Command, Observer, Object Pool etc</p>
